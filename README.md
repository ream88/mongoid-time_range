# mongoid-time_range

Mongoid::TimeRange defines a TimeRange type for your Mongoid apps, which is an object with `from` and `to` keys.

## Installation

In your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mongoid-time_range'
```

## Usage

```ruby
class Document
  include Mongoid::Document

  field :range, type: Mongoid::TimeRange
end
```

```ruby
document = Document.create
document.range # => { from: 2013-01-01 00:00:00 +0100, to: nil }

year2013 = Document.create(range: { from: Time.now.at_beginning_of_year, to: Time.now.end_of_year })
year2013.range # => { from: 2013-01-01 00:00:00 +0100, to: 2013-12-31 23:59:59 +0100 }
```

If you want to use `TimeRange` directly instead of `Mongoid::TimeRange`:

```ruby
class Document
  include Mongoid::Document

  field :range, type: TimeRange
end

â€¦ your Gemfile must include a additional require statement:

```ruby
gem 'mongoid-time_range', require: 'mongoid/time_range/global'
```
